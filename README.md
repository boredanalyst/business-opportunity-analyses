# Business Opportunity Analysis

In this Jupyter Notebook project, I explore the time it takes to start a business in various countries. Using a dataset on business startup procedures and durations, I clean the data, perform analysis, and create visualizations to uncover insights into startup timelines across countries. Through informative charts and graphs, I aim to identify trends, factors affecting startup times, and variations in business startup processes worldwide.

Keywords: business startup, time to start a business, data analysis, data visualization, Jupyter Notebook.
